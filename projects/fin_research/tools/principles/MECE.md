# MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

## 1) Concept Overview
MECE requires grouping a problem **without overlap and without omission**: **Mutually Exclusive** (no overlaps) + **Collectively Exhaustive** (no gaps). It is commonly used for structured problem-solving and information organization.

## 2) When to Use
- When first building a **problem tree / indicator framework** to avoid double-counting or missing key dimensions.
- When aligning terminology and boundaries **across teams** to reduce communication ambiguity.

## 3) Applications in Financial Analysis & Reporting
- **Financial indicator framework**: MECE decomposition across the three statements (Income Statement / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow) and key drivers (e.g., **volume × price**, **price − unit cost** for margin logic, **capacity × utilization × yield** for production).
- **Risk register**: Layer risks into **company-internal / industry-external / policy & regulation / execution & trading** buckets with mutually exclusive categories.
- **Report structure**: Chapters that do not overlap and, taken together, fully answer the question.

## 4) Actionable Procedure
1. Write a clear problem statement and scope (**time horizon, market, entities**).
2. Try several grouping schemes (by **nature / causality / time / user segment / channel**, etc.) and select the most explanatory one.
3. Drill down level by level, **mark boundaries** and **define metrics**, eliminating overlaps.
4. Run a **completeness check** (against the business map / value chain / competitive landscape).
5. **Test-run with sample data** to confirm there is no double-counting or missing items.

## 5) Outline Skeleton for a Report
- Problem statement & scope
- MECE framework diagram (Level-1 / Level-2)
- Key metrics and measurement methods for each dimension
- Cross-checks and definition / scope consistency notes
- Conclusions & follow-up data-collection plan

## 6) Common Pitfalls & Checks
- Chasing **“formal MECE”** while ignoring business intuition → **prioritize the partition that best explains reality**.
- Too many dimensions raising cognitive load → **aim for 3–5 primary buckets**.
- Missing definitions / scopes → **write a one-sentence definition for each dimension**.
