# Value Chain Analysis (Porter)

## 1) Concept Overview
Porter’s value chain divides a firm’s activities into **five primary activities**—**Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Marketing & Sales, Service**—and **four support activities**—**Procurement, Human Resource Management, Technology Development, Firm Infrastructure**. The goal is to pinpoint **where value is created and where costs arise** so you can strengthen competitive advantage and expand margin.

## 2) When to Use
- To assess **sources of cost advantage or differentiation**, locate profit pools, and identify improvement levers.
- To decompose an **industry/sector position** across the chain (upstream resources → midstream manufacturing → downstream channels/services).

## 3) Applications in Financial Analysis & Report Writing
- **Cost curve & gross-margin drivers:** identify materials, process steps, yield, scale effects, and learning curves.
- **Industry pass-through:** analyze how upstream price changes (e.g., lithium, nickel, polysilicon) transmit to mid/downstream **ASP (average selling price)** and gross margin.
- **Investment takeaway:** highlight moat-rich links and the biggest **“profit levers”** (e.g., patents/know-how, automation, proprietary processes).

## 4) Actionable Steps
1. Map the target firm/industry **activity chain** (primary + support activities).
2. Annotate each link with **cost/value drivers** (scale, yield, IP/patents, channel density, after-sales).
3. Identify **bottlenecks and uplift levers** (automation, process iteration, vertical integration vs. outsourcing).
4. **Quantify** the impact on **gross margin / ROIC / cash flow**, and turn it into investment arguments.
5. Add **peer comparisons** and **substitute-technology** assessment (e.g., sodium-ion, solid-state, cobalt-free).

## 5) Report Outline Skeleton
- Value-chain overview (primary + support activities)
- Key links vs. cost/value drivers
- Improvement roadmap and **CAPEX/OPEX** implications
- Relative advantages vs. competitors / substitute technologies
- Conclusion & monitoring metrics

## 6) Common Pitfalls & Checks
- Drawing the chain without quantification → **tie findings to GM/ROIC/CF with numbers**.
- Ignoring support activities’ role → **surface tech, talent, and procurement system impacts**.
- Detaching from industry structure → **layer in upstream/downstream bargaining power and policy factors**.
