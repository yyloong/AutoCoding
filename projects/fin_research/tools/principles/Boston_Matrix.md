# BCG Growth–Share Matrix (Boston Matrix)

## 1) Concept Overview
The BCG matrix evaluates a portfolio of businesses/products along two dimensions: **Relative Market Share (x-axis)** and **Market Growth Rate (y-axis)**. The four quadrants are:

- **Stars**: High share / high growth — warrant continued investment to sustain leadership.
- **Cash Cows**: High share / low growth — generate stable cash flow to fund other units.
- **Question Marks** (also “Problem Children”): Low share / high growth — require careful evaluation to either scale up or divest.
- **Dogs**: Low share / low growth — typically candidates for harvesting, restructuring, or exit.

> Notes for rigor: define how you compute relative market share (e.g., vs. the largest competitor; log scale is common) and specify the time window for growth rate.

## 2) When to Use
- To **map and prioritize a business/asset portfolio** and support **resource reallocation**.
- To compare **industry subsegments** or a company’s **multiple business lines** by stage/maturity.

## 3) Applications in Financial Analysis / Report Writing
- **Industry/Subsector comparison**: Position subsectors (e.g., new-energy materials, EV OEMs, stationary storage) by growth and share to justify allocating capital toward “Stars” or likely future Stars.
- **Single-stock business breakdown**: Place a target company’s business lines (e.g., traction batteries, energy storage, materials, recycling) in the matrix to show how **Cash Cows** fund **Stars/Question Marks**.
- **Actionable investment calls**: Link quadrant placement to “**Overweight / Hold / Watch / Underweight**” with supporting cash-flow and capex assumptions.

## 4) Operational Steps (Executable)
1. Select the analysis scope (sector, company, or business line) and define granularity.
2. For each unit, estimate **market growth rate** and **relative market share** (benchmarked against the largest competitor).
3. Plot the matrix and annotate **cash generation vs. funding needs** (Cash Cows → Stars/Question Marks).
4. For each quadrant, define **strategy and triggers** — **Invest / Nurture / Test / Exit** with explicit thresholds (share, margin improvement, policy inflection).
5. Translate matrix conclusions into **portfolio weights** and **tracking KPIs** (e.g., market share, ASP, cost curve, capacity ramp).

## 5) Example Report Skeleton
- Portfolio landscape (industry/company) → matrix figure
- Quadrant-by-quadrant interpretation (Stars / Cash Cows / Question Marks / Dogs)
- Cash flows and capex alignment (Cash Cows → Stars/Question Marks)
- Investment recommendations and target weights → key KPIs and scenario tracking

## 6) Common Pitfalls and Checks
- Arbitrary “high/low” cutoffs → **state explicit thresholds and justify them** (industry norms, historical percentiles).
- Ignoring **time dynamics** (quadrant migration) → **outline 1–2 year migration paths with triggers**.
- Overreliance on a single metric → **cross-check with gross margin, cash flow, and ROIC for consistency**.
