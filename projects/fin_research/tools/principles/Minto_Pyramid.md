# Pyramid Principle (Minto Pyramid)

## 1) Concept Overview
The core idea is **top-down communication**: **lead with the answer**, then give **2–4 parallel supporting points**, and finally provide data and details. It is often paired with **SCQA** (Situation–Complication–Question–Answer).

## 2) When to Use
- Concise communication to **decision-makers**: executive summaries, investment committee materials.
- When compressing extensive analysis into **a one-page/one-paragraph takeaway**.

## 3) Applications in Financial Analysis & Reporting
- Open with a **one-sentence investment call** (Buy/Hold/Sell + target price/range + key drivers).
- Present **three parallel argument layers** (fundamentals; valuation & comps; catalysts & risk hedges).
- Attach **charts and evidence** beneath (financial breakdowns, sensitivities, scenarios).

## 4) Actionable Steps
1. Write a **one-sentence answer** (direction + confidence).
2. Synthesize **2–4 parallel supports** that are **same-level and logically independent**.
3. For each support, prepare the **strongest evidence** (1–2 charts/tables + a one-sentence takeaway).
4. Use **SCQA** to introduce the problem and “**why now**.”
5. Run an **inverted-pyramid audit**: remove any material that does **not** directly support the conclusion.

## 5) Report Skeleton
- One-sentence investment conclusion (with range and time frame)
- Supporting arguments A/B/C (each with 1–2 charts)
- Key assumptions plus scenarios/sensitivities
- Risks and hedges
- Actionable recommendations and tracking indicators

## 6) Common Pitfalls & Checks
- Telling the process before the answer → **must be answer-first**.
- Overlap across parallel points → **enforce MECE at the same level**.
- Evidence dumping → **keep only the strongest evidence per point**.
