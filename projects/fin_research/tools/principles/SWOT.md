# SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

## 1) Principle Overview
SWOT systematically organizes **internal factors** (Strengths / Weaknesses) and **external factors** (Opportunities / Threats) to form an integrated view for strategy and action. It’s often extended into **TOWS** (Threats–Opportunities–Weaknesses–Strengths) to **pair** internal and external items into concrete strategies.

## 2) When to Use
- Building **company/industry research frameworks**, IPO/M&A due-diligence checkpoints, and post-investment monitoring focuses.
- Rapid strategy refresh when major **external variables** change (e.g., policy shifts, technology inflection points).

## 3) Applications in Financial Analysis / Report Writing
- **Company profile**: derive S/W from cost curve, technology moats, capacity/channels, unit economics, management quality.
- **External environment**: derive O/T from policy, supply–demand, competitive structure/entry barriers, input prices, and macro cycles.
- **Strategy pairing (TOWS)**:
  - **S–O**: scale with advantages;
  - **W–O**: fix gaps to capture upside;
  - **S–T**: use strengths to hedge;
  - **W–T**: defend/exit to limit downside.

## 4) Actionable Steps
1. Define the objective and time window (e.g., next 2–4 quarters).
2. Aggregate internal/external evidence and place items into **S / W / O / T** quadrants.
3. Run **TOWS pairing** to generate **SO / WO / ST / WT** strategies with clear **KPIs**.
4. Map strategies to **financial impact** (revenue drivers, gross margin, capex, cash flow, working capital).
5. Specify **triggers & risk controls** (e.g., if **T > O** or **W** widens, define adjustment playbooks).

## 5) Report Skeleton
- One-page **SWOT overview table**
- **TOWS pairings** and action checklist (owner, KPI, timeline)
- **Financial mapping** and scenario analysis
- **Risks & monitoring indicators** (with thresholds/triggers)

## 6) Common Pitfalls & Checks
- Bullet lists with no execution path → **Must produce TOWS “paired strategies + KPIs.”**
- Blurred internal vs external factors → **Label items explicitly as “internal/external.”**
- Static snapshot → **Set quarterly review cadence and update on new data/policy/competitor moves.**
