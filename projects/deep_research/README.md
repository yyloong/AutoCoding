# Agentic Insight

### Lightweight, Efficient, and Extensible Multi-modal Deep Research Framework

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

This project provides a framework for deep research, enabling agents to autonomously explore and execute complex tasks.

### 🌟 Features

- **Autonomous Exploration** - Autonomous exploration for various complex tasks

- **Multimodal** - Capable of processing diverse data modalities and generating research reports rich in both text and images.

- **Lightweight & Efficient** - Support "search-then-execute" mode, completing complex research tasks within few minutes, significantly reducing token consumption.

- **Expandable Deep Search Architecture** — Scales from lightweight search to recursive deep search with auto-generated follow-up questions; configurable breadth/depth; clean context handoff via dense *learnings*; multimodal report assembly (via docling) that preserves figure/table captions and ordering.


### 📺 Demonstration

Here is a demonstration of the Agentic Insight framework in action, showcasing its capabilities in handling complex research tasks efficiently.

* Chinese:
```text
在计算化学这个领域，我们通常使用Gaussian软件模拟各种情况下分子的结构和性质计算，比如在关键词中加入'field=x+100'代表了在x方向增加了电场。但是，当体系是经典的单原子催化剂时，它属于分子催化剂，在反应环境中分子的朝向是不确定的，那么理论模拟的x方向电场和实际电场是不一致的。

请问：通常情况下，理论计算是如何模拟外加电场存在的情况？
```

* English:
```text
In the field of computational chemistry, we often use Gaussian software to simulate the structure and properties of molecules under various conditions. For instance, adding 'field=x+100' to the keywords signifies an electric field applied along the x-direction. However, when dealing with a classical single-atom catalyst, which falls under molecular catalysis, the orientation of the molecule in the reaction environment is uncertain. This means the x-directional electric field in the theoretical simulation might not align with the actual electric field.

So, how are external electric fields typically simulated in theoretical calculations?

### 🛠️ Installation

To set up the Agentic Insight framework, follow these steps:

* Installation
```bash
# From source code
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/ms-agent.git
pip install -r requirements/research.txt
pip install -e .

# From PyPI (>=v1.1.0)
pip install 'ms-agent[research]'
```

### 🚀 Quickstart

#### Environment Setting

By default, the system uses free **arXiv search** (no API key required).  Optionally, you can switch to **Exa** or **SerpApi** for broader web search.

1. Copy and edit your `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Then, edit `.env` to include the API key for the search engine you choose:
# If using Exa (register at https://exa.ai, free quota available):
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
# If using SerpApi (register at https://serpapi.com, free quota available):
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key

# If you are using DeepResearch variant (ResearchWorkflowBeta), **search-query rewriting** is pinned to a stable model (e.g., **gemini-2.5-flash**) for reliability.
# An OpenAI-compatible base URL (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) and API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) are required. To switch models, replace the pinned name in `ResearchWorkflowBeta.generate_search_queries` with any model served by your configured endpoint.
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1
```

2. Configure the search engine in conf.yaml:
```yaml
SEARCH_ENGINE:
    engine: exa
    exa_api_key: $EXA_API_KEY
```
