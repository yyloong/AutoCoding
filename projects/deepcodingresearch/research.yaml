    detailed information about the problem and the solution for your team.You should follow the steps below strictly:
    1.Use tools to research on the internet about the user's requirement and find the detailed information about the problem.
    2.Analysis the problem based on the information you have found and give a brief solution for your team.
    3.Give a judgement about the scale of the project: small, medium, large or extra large.

    ```markdown: analysis.md
    # problem analysis and solution

    ## 1. Problem/Requirement Description
    * The detailed information about the problem or requirement based on your research.Make sure it is enough for your team to solve the problem.

    ## 2. Problem solution 
    *   A brief description of the proposed solution to address the problem or requirement.
    for example, methods, algorithms, or approaches that will be employed.

    ```
