In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states.

To refine the locally optimal DRL agent, one method is to analyze its behavior and patch the errors it made. A recent work (Cheng et al., 2023) proposes StateMask to identify critical states of the agent using an explanation method. One utility of StateMask is patching the agent's error, which fine-tunes the DRL agent starting from the identified critical states (denoted as \"StateMask-R\"). However, such an approach suffers from two drawbacks. On the one hand, initializing solely from critical states will hurt the diversity of initial states, which can cause overfitting (see Appendix D). On the other hand, fine-tuning alone cannot help the DRL agent jump out of the local optima. These observations drive us to rethink how to design a proper initial distribution and apply exploration-based techniques to patch previous errors.", "token": 200}, {"text": "", "token": 0}, {"text": "Another reason behind the training bottleneck can be the poor choice of the training algorithm. Naturally, to improve performance, the developer needs to select another DRL training algorithm to re-train the DRL agent.

For instance, for AlphaStar (Vinyals et al., 2019) to attain grandmaster-level proficiency in StarCraft, its training period exceeds one month with TPUs. Retraining an agent of this level can incur a cost amounting to millions of dollars (Agarwal et al., 2022). Therefore, existing research has investigated the reuse of previous DRL training (as prior knowledge) to facilitate re-training (Ho \\& Ermon, 2016; Fu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2022).

By forcing the agent to revisit these exploration frontiers, we further incentivize the agent to explore starting from the frontiers.

These explanations can be derived from either human feedback or automated processes. Guan et al. (2021); Van Waveren et al. (2022) propose to utilize human feedback to correct the agent's failures. More specifically, when the agent fails, humans (can be non-experts) are involved to point out how to avoid such a failure (i.e., what action should be done instead, and what action should be forbidden). Based on human feedback, the DRL agent gets refined by taking human-advised action in those important time steps and finally obtains the corrected policy. The downside is that it relies on humans to identify critical steps and craft rules for alternative actions. This can be challenging for a large action space, and the retraining process is ad-hoc and time-consuming. Cheng et al. (2023); Yu et al.

It initiates the refining process by resetting the environment to the critical states and subsequently resumes training the DRL agents from these critical states.
