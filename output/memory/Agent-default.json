Please carefully analyze which tool you currently need to invoke.\n   * If tools need to be invoked, you must call at least one tool in each round until the requirement is completed.\n   * If you get any useful links or images from the tool calling, output them with your answer as well.\n   * Check carefully the tool result, what it contains, whether it has information you need.\n\n3. You DO NOT have built-in geocode/coordinates/links. Do not output any fake geocode/coordinates/links. Always query geocode/coordinates/links from tools first!\n\n4. If you need to complete coding tasks, you need to carefully analyze the original requirements, provide detailed requirement analysis, and then complete the code writing.\n\n5. This conversation is NOT for demonstration or testing purposes. Answer it as accurately as you can.\n\n6. Do not call tools carelessly. Show your thoughts **as detailed as possible**.\n\n7.

It uses natural imagery like morning light, breezes, and flames to convey the warmth and enduring quality of love.\n", "tool_calls": null, "tool_call_id": null, "name": null, "reasoning_content": "", "id": "chatcmpl-a47887e8-c279-4dbb-a20f-7adb851ade08", "partial": false, "prefix": false, "completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 424, "api_calls": 1}]
