    Computes two sets of metrics. The first (top level) set of metrics is computed by
    EXCLUDING rollouts that terminated in system errors. The second (nested) set of metrics
    is computed by treating system errors as failures (a pessimistic lower bound of the
    accuracy).

    Note that it is sometimes not possible to have *valid* metrics when you exclude the system
    errors. This is for two reasons:

    1. Suppose you run with 16 rollouts per instance and want to calculate pass@16, but one of
       the rollouts fails. If you exclude it, you fundamentally don't have enough information
       to calculate pass@16 anymore.
    2. Sometimes all samples for a given instance may fail, which means excluding all of them
       excludes the instance entirely from metrics. This means you effectively are evaluating
       on an arbitrary subset of the dataset, which is not valid.

    Due to these issues, we return a boolean `is_valid` field in the top level metrics that indicates
    if the metrics are valid or not. We also only report `metric@k` metrics when we actually got >= k
    rollouts for every instance (otherwise it reports an error in a string).

    The `metrics_including_errors` field does not suffer from the caveats above, but it is a
    pessimistic lower bound of the accuracy that may be affected by things other than the capability
    of the model under test (i.e., any system errors).
