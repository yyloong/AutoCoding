The notebook is implemented in Python, runs in 1 minute and 5 seconds, and includes structured sections covering data acquisition, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation. Although the title suggests a score of 0.80593, the documented public and best scores are both 0.80266—still satisfying the user's requirement of over 0.8.

The solution outputs predictions in a CSV file named 'solution.csv', containing PassengerId and corresponding boolean predictions for the 'Transported' target variable. The notebook was executed in 60 seconds using Python and is associated with the official 'Spaceship Titanic' Kaggle competition.

Key steps include:\n\n- Dropping non-informative columns: \"PassengerId\" and \"Name\".\n- Feature engineering on the \"Cabin\" column by splitting it into three new features: \"cabin_code\", \"id_cabin\", and \"cabin_sector\" using '/' as a delimiter. The author notes that \"cabin_code\" has 8 unique values and shows through visualizations that passengers in sections B and C have higher transport rates, while those in E have lower rates. Similarly, sector S has a higher transport rate than sector P.\n- Removing the original \"Cabin\" column and the derived \"id_cabin\" (treated as an ID with no predictive value).\n- Converting the target variable \"Transported\" from boolean to binary (True → 1, False → 0).\n- Dropping rows where \"cabin_code\" is missing.\n- Separating features into categorical and numerical types for tailored preprocessing.\n- Building two scikit-learn Pipelines:\n  - Categorical pipeline: imputes missing values with the mode and applies TargetEncoder.\n  - Numerical pipeline: imputes missing values using KNNImputer with n_neighbors=3.\n- Combining pipelines via ColumnTransformer.\n- Comparing three tree-based models using StratifiedKFold cross-validation (5 folds): XGBoost (default), XGBoost with gblinear booster, and LGBMClassifier. **LGBMClassifier performed best**.\n- Performing hyperparameter tuning on LGBMClassifier using GridSearchCV with parameters:\n  python\n  lgbm_params = {\n      \"n_estimators\": [100,200,300],\n      \"learning_rate\": [0.01,0.05,0.1,0.3],\n      \"num_leaves\": [20,50,80,100]\n  }\n  \n- Training the final tuned LGBM model and evaluating it on a hold-out test set, reporting metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n- The author explicitly states: \"The strategies that I mention in this article led me to a **0.80664 score** in the competition...\"\n\nCode snippets and visual evidence (bar plots showing cabin/sector transport probabilities) support the methodology.\n\nSummary: \nThe article presents a solution that scored 0.80664 (top 7%) on the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition. The approach hinges on insightful feature engineering—particularly splitting the 'Cabin' field into 'cabin_code', 'id_cabin', and 'cabin_sector'—and discarding non-predictive columns like 'PassengerId' and 'Name'. After converting the target to binary and removing rows with missing 'cabin_code', the author uses a ColumnTransformer to separately preprocess categorical (mode imputation + TargetEncoding) and numerical (KNN imputation) features. Model selection via stratified cross-validation identified LGBMClassifier as superior to XGBoost variants. Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV optimized n_estimators, learning_rate, and num_leaves. The final model achieved strong performance metrics and a public leaderboard score above 0.8, fulfilling the user's goal.",

Problem/Requirement Description\\n* The Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition requires participants to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. The goal is to achieve a public leaderboard score exceeding 0.8.\\n\\nBased on research of successful solutions that achieved scores above 0.8:\\n- Prisca Chang achieved a score of 0.80266 using a comprehensive data science approach\\n- Priyanka Palshetkar achieved a score of 0.80336 \\n- Fernando Lacerda Dantas achieved a score of 0.80664 (top 7%) using specific feature engineering and model selection techniques\\n\\nKey elements from high-scoring solutions include:\\n1. Feature engineering, particularly splitting the \\\"Cabin\\\" column into three components: \\\"cabin_code\\\", \\\"id_cabin\\\", and \\\"cabin_sector\\\"\\n2. Dropping non-informative columns like \\\"PassengerId\\\" and \\\"Name\\\"\\n3. Converting the target variable \\\"Transported\\\" from boolean to binary (True → 1, False → 0)\\n4. Removing rows with missing critical values (e.g., missing \\\"cabin_code\\\")\\n5. Separate preprocessing pipelines for categorical and numerical features\\n6. Using advanced tree-based models, particularly LGBMClassifier which outperformed XGBoost variants\\n7. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with parameters like n_estimators, learning_rate, and num_leaves\\n\\n## 2. Problem solution \\n*   The proposed solution should implement the following approach:\\n    1. Data preprocessing: Drop non-informative columns (\\\"PassengerId\\\", \\\"Name\\\"), split \\\"Cabin\\\" into meaningful components, and convert target to binary\\n    2. Handle missing values: Remove rows with critical missing values and use appropriate imputation strategies (mode for categorical, KNNImputer for numerical)\\n    3. Feature engineering: Create new features from existing ones, particularly from the \\\"Cabin\\\" field which shows strong correlation with the target\\n    4. Model selection: Use stratified cross-validation to compare tree-based models (LGBMClassifier, XGBoost)\\n    5. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize the best performing model using GridSearchCV with parameters like n_estimators [100,200,300], learning_rate [0.01,0.05,0.1,0.3], and num_leaves [20,50,80,100]\\n    6. Final evaluation: Train the tuned model and generate predictions for submission\\n\\n## 3. The Scale of the Project\\n* medium\\nThis project requires a structured machine learning pipeline with proper data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. While it can be implemented in a single notebook/script, it involves multiple steps and considerations that go beyond a simple script but doesn't require a complex distributed system.\"}",
