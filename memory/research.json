Key steps included:\n\n1. **Feature Engineering from Cabin Column**: The original 'Cabin' column (e.g., \"A/5/S\") was split into three new features: 'cabin_code' (deck letter), 'id_cabin' (cabin number), and 'cabin_sector' (P or S for port/starboard). Exploratory analysis showed that passengers in cabin sections B and C had higher transport rates, while those in E had lower rates; similarly, sector S had higher transport probability than P. After extraction, both the original 'Cabin' and 'id_cabin' columns were dropped.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**: The 'PassengerId' and 'Name' columns were removed as non-informative. Rows with missing values in 'cabin_code' were dropped. The target variable 'Transported' was converted from boolean to binary (True→1, False→0).\n\n3. **Pipeline Construction**: A ColumnTransformer was used to handle numerical and categorical features separately:\n   - Categorical features: Imputed with the most frequent value, then encoded using TargetEncoder.\n   - Numerical features: Imputed using KNNImputer with n_neighbors=3.\n\n4. **Model Selection**: Three tree-based models were compared via 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation: XGBoost (default), XGBoost with gblinear booster, and LGBMClassifier. LGBMClassifier achieved the highest cross-validated accuracy and was selected.\n\n5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV was applied to the LGBMClassifier with the following parameter grid:\n   - n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]\n   - learning_rate: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3]\n   - num_leaves: [20, 50, 80, 100]\n   The best parameters from this search were used to configure the final model.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: The final model was evaluated on a held-out test set using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, all of which indicated strong performance. The resulting submission scored 0.80664 on the Kaggle public leaderboard, placing the solution in the top 7%.\n\nSummary: \nThe author achieved a Kaggle Spaceship Titanic score of 0.80664 (top 7%) through a methodical approach centered on insightful feature engineering—particularly splitting the 'Cabin' field into deck, number, and sector—and leveraging domain-aware insights (e.g., B/C decks and S sector correlate with higher transport likelihood). The pipeline combined Target Encoding for categorical variables and KNN imputation for numerical ones, processed via sklearn’s ColumnTransformer. After comparing XGBoost and LightGBM via stratified cross-validation, LightGBM was selected and optimized using GridSearchCV over key hyperparameters (n_estimators, learning_rate, num_leaves). This end-to-end strategy—combining data understanding, robust preprocessing, model validation, and hyperparameter tuning—enabled the high-performance result.",

Building a model with only numerical features.\n2. Building a model with only categorical features.\n3. Building a model with all features combined.\n\nFor numerical features, the author defines:\n\nNUMS = ['RoomService', 'FoodCourt', 'ShoppingMall', 'Spa', 'VRDeck','Num', 'Expenditure','Group_size','Expenditure']\n\nA custom forward feature selection function is implemented using k-fold cross-validation (k=5) and logistic regression as the base model to identify the most predictive features. The function iteratively adds features that improve accuracy and removes those that degrade performance.\n\nAfter feature selection, the model using only 'good' numerical features achieved ~0.78 accuracy. The author then evaluates multiple classification models—including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, SGD, KNN, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting variants (HistGradientBoosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)—on numerical features alone, achieving up to ~0.79 accuracy.\n\nWhen testing only categorical features (after encoding), the best result was ~0.75.\n\nFinally, combining both numerical and categorical features and re-evaluating all models yielded a peak cross-validated accuracy of **~0.81** using **HistGradientBoostingClassifier**.\n\nThe author notes further improvements are possible via:\n- Fine-tuning top-performing models\n- Additional feature engineering\n- Applying the same forward feature selection method to the full feature set\n\nThe complete code is available at: https://github.com/devang007/ArticleNotebooks/blob/main/Spaceshi-titanic%20Article.ipynb\n\nSummary: \nThe article details a systematic approach to surpassing 80% accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition by comparing models trained on numerical features, categorical features, and their combination. Using forward feature selection with logistic regression and 5-fold cross-validation, the author identifies high-impact numerical features. After evaluating ten classifiers, HistGradientBoostingClassifier achieved the highest performance—approximately 81% accuracy—when trained on the combined set of engineered numerical and encoded categorical features. The author suggests further gains are possible through hyperparameter tuning and refined feature engineering, and provides full code for reproducibility.",

Problem/Requirement Description\\n* The Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition is a binary classification problem where participants must predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension based on various features. The dataset includes passenger information such as cabin details, spending habits, and demographic data.\\n\\nBased on research of high-scoring solutions (0.8+), successful approaches share several key components:\\n\\n1. **Feature Engineering**: \\n   - Splitting the 'Cabin' column into three separate features: deck (cabin_code), cabin number (id_cabin), and sector (P/S for port/starboard)\\n   - Creating expenditure features by summing luxury amenities (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck)\\n   - Extracting group information from PassengerId to determine group size\\n\\n2. **Data Preprocessing**:\\n   - Handling missing values with appropriate strategies (KNN imputation for numerical features, mode imputation for categorical)\\n   - Removing non-informative columns like 'Name' and 'PassengerId'\\n   - Converting boolean targets to binary (True→1, False→0)\\n\\n3. **Encoding Strategies**:\\n   - Using Target Encoding for categorical variables\\n   - Proper handling of categorical vs numerical features through ColumnTransformer\\n\\n4. **Model Selection and Tuning**:\\n   - Tree-based models consistently perform well (LightGBM, XGBoost, HistGradientBoosting)\\n   - Cross-validation (typically 5-fold stratified) for robust model evaluation\\n   - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV focusing on key parameters like n_estimators, learning_rate, and num_leaves\\n\\n## 2. Problem solution \\n*   A brief description of the proposed solution to address the problem or requirement.\\nThe recommended approach combines systematic feature engineering with ensemble tree methods:\\n\\n1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**:\\n   - Split Cabin into deck, number, and sector features\\n   - Create total expenditure feature from luxury spending columns\\n   - Extract group size from PassengerId structure\\n\\n2. **Preprocessing Strategy**:\\n   - Use ColumnTransformer to handle numerical and categorical features separately\\n   - Apply KNNImputer (n_neighbors=3) for numerical missing values\\n   - Use TargetEncoder for categorical variables\\n\\n3. **Model Implementation**:\\n   - Start with LightGBM or HistGradientBoostingClassifier as base models\\n   - Implement 5-fold stratified cross-validation for model selection\\n   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with parameters:\\n     - n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]\\n     - learning_rate: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3]\\n     - num_leaves: [20, 50, 80, 100] (for LightGBM)\\n\\n4. **Validation Approach**:\\n   - Use multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for comprehensive evaluation\\n   - Consider forward feature selection to identify most predictive features\\n\\n## 3. The Scale of the Project\\n* a brief judgement about the scale of the project: small, medium, large or extra large.\\nThis is a medium-scale project. While it involves multiple steps (data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning), it can be implemented in a single comprehensive notebook or a few coordinated Python scripts. The dataset is manageable in size, and the computational requirements are moderate, making it suitable for standard machine learning workflows without requiring distributed computing or complex infrastructure.\"}",
